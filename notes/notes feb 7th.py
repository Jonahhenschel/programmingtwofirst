#list slicing is bassically taking a slice out of the list
# it means you are taking a predetermined slice of the list
list2=[50, 70, 30, 20,90,10]
syntax: lst (initial[1:5])
it would print 70-10

.sort sorts it in ascending order or we can do .sort reverse=true it sorts in decsending order
it can sort floasts alphbaetically or sorts ints by size3
.reverse just reverses the list [1.2,3] would print 3 2 1
extend function
list1=[1,2]
list2=[2,3]
list2.extend(list1)
print(str(list2))
result 1,2,3,2
